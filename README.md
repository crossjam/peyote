### Release Management

This project uses automated release management with GitHub Actions:

#### Version Bumping
- `poe publish_patch` - Bump patch version, commit, tag, and push
- `poe publish_minor` - Bump minor version, commit, tag, and push  
- `poe publish_major` - Bump major version, commit, tag, and push

#### Release Notes
- `poe changelog` - Generate changelog since last tag
- `poe release-notes` - Generate release notes file

#### Automatic Releases
When you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`), the unified GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. **Test** - Run tests across all supported Python versions and OS combinations
2. **Publish** - Build and publish to PyPI (only if tests pass)
3. **GitHub Release** - Create GitHub release with auto-generated notes and artifacts (only if PyPI publish succeeds)

This ensures a complete release pipeline where each step depends on the previous step's success.

#### MkDocs Documentation
- `poe docs-serve` - Serve documentation locally
- `poe docs-build` - Build documentation
- `poe docs-deploy` - Deploy to GitHub Pages

The template includes MkDocs with readthedocs theme and automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.
